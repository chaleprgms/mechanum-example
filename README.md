# mechanum-example
Brief example code to show how a mecanum drive train is run using java for FRC


In here you'll find:
 - A Drive Command 
 - A Drive Subsystem
 - Large comments, as well as a link to a document about mecanum vectors


If this repo doesnt get the job done, contact me through our Collective Rep and I'll be in touch as soon as possible

Hope you have a whaley good time programming!
